# Industruino demo code
When you receive your Industruino, you will find this sketch installed on it, depending on your version of the topboard: 32u4 or 1286. The sketch will ask you which baseboard you are using: PROTO or IND.I/O and then you can test the features by going through the menus using the membrane panel buttons.
